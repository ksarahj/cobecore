Although COBECORE has been accepted as to be funded, some political hurdles remain. Currently we are waiting final approval of the scientific working budget of the comming year. Although this should be a formality no working budget can be released until after signing of the budget.

We await the decision of [Elke Sleurs](http://www.belgium.be/nl/over_belgie/overheid/federale_overheid/federale_regering/samenstelling_regering/index_elke_sleurs) on finalizing and approving the budget before formally starting the COBECORE project.
