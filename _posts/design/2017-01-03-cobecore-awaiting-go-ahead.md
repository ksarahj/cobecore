COBECORE brings together an interdisciplinary network of partners, including the main institutes curating eco-climatological legacy data of the central Congo Basin. The global objective of this 4-year project is to establish baseline measurements necessary in long-term ecological and climatological research, valorizing as of yet unexplored heritage. To this end, COBECORE will develop a multi-faceted database, by making the static analog INEAC archives digitally accessible and extracting eco-physiological relevant plant traits from historic BGM herbarium specimens. In order to speed up data processing, and provide highly visible public outreach, we will crowd-source transcription of the climatological data and stomatal density counts.
